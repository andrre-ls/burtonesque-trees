# Burton*esque* Trees


#### About
This is a generative design project that draws SVG tree silhouettes inspired by the visual aesthetic most commonly associated with Tim Burton. Each tree is randomly generated based on a unique seed and the set of parameters.
  
The project originated as an assignment for a generative design class that I attended back in 2020 as part of the Master's degree in Design and Multimedia at the University of Coimbra. The assignment instructed us to use generative techniques to create visual artefacts characterised by ramifications. My assignment embraced the ever-so-popular approach of generating [trees through heavy recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)#/media/File:RecursiveTree.JPG) but twisted it into something far more parametric and stylised. In the end, I was so pleased with the outputs that now, a year later, I decided to refactor the original algorithm and implement a user interface to control it.

#### Credits
The tree generator script relies on the *random()* and *noise()* methods of [p5.js](https://github.com/processing/p5.js), and the user interface was built with [Svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte).
